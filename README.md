# DormCentral

DormCentral is a web application project for CS 35L's Winter 2023 course. This web app serves as a utility for UCLA students to get more information about their dorm selection for the following year.

## Our Tech Stack
For the front end, we utilized React to build our user interface and MaterialUI's components libraries to aid us in styling the website. For the backend, we utilized Firebase, namely it's Cloud Firestore Database to store user reviews, parties, etc. In turn, Google's Firebase API allowed us to read and write to their backend servers.
